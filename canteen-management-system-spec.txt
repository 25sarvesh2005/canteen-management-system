# Canteen Management System - Complete Specification with Developer Checklist

## Project Overview
Create a comprehensive Canteen Management System for a college with two distinct interfaces: a User Interface for students ordering food and an Admin Interface for the canteen staff to manage orders and inventory. The overall design should be clean, minimal, and feature gradient translucent colors.

## Part 1: The Login & Authentication Flow
Create a single, clean, and modern login page that serves as the entry point for both students (users) and the canteen administration.

**Design:** The login page should have a clean layout with a blurred, gradient background.

**Functionality:**
- Include fields for "Username" and "Password."
- Implement a toggle or switch component that allows users to seamlessly switch between "Student Login" and "Admin Login" modes.
- Add a "Forgot Password?" link and a simple "Sign Up" option for new students.

## Part 2: The User (Student) Interface
This interface should be intuitive and engaging for students to order food effortlessly.

### 1. The Dashboard / Home Page:
- **Welcome Message:** A personalized greeting, such as "What are you craving today, [User's Name]?".
- **Featured Items:** A horizontally scrolling section showcasing "Today's Specials" or "Most Popular Items."
- **Quick Actions:** Buttons for "View Menu," "My Orders," and "My Stats."

### 2. The Menu & Ordering Section:
**Layout:** Display food items in a clean grid or list format. Each item should have:
- A high-quality image.
- Item name (e.g., "Samosa," "Vada Pav," "Masala Chai," "Cold Drink").
- Price.
- An estimated preparation time (e.g., "Ready in 5-7 mins").
- A button to "Add to Cart."

**Availability:** If an item is out of stock, it should be greyed out with an "Out of Stock" label. This should update in real-time based on the admin's inventory.

**Shopping Cart:** A slide-in or pop-up cart that allows users to review their selected items, adjust quantities, and see the total bill before placing an order.

### 3. "My Orders" - The History System:
**Current Orders:** A dedicated section to show the status of active orders. Include:
- The unique order token/number.
- Order status (e.g., "Order Placed," "In the Kitchen," "Ready for Pickup").
- A real-time countdown or progress bar based on the initial prep time estimate.

**Past Orders:** A list of all previous orders, allowing users to easily re-order their favorites with a single click.

### 4. The "My Stats" Gamified Dashboard:
This section is designed to be fun and engaging.

**Visualizations:** Use charts and graphs to show the user's ordering habits.
- A pie chart of their "Most Ordered Items."
- A bar graph showing their "Weekly Spending."

**Calorie Tracker:**
- Provide an estimated calorie count for each item.
- Display a fun, visual representation of their total estimated calorie intake for the week (e.g., "You've consumed enough energy to power a rocket to the moon! (Just kidding, but here's your weekly total!)").
- Include fun facts or healthy eating tips.

## Part 3: The Admin (Canteen) Interface
This interface needs to be highly functional and efficient for the canteen staff to manage operations smoothly.

### 1. The Main Dashboard - Order Tickets:
**Layout:** A multi-column layout (similar to a Kanban board) to display incoming orders as "tickets." The columns should be:
- "New Orders": All incoming orders appear here with a timestamp. Each ticket should show the items ordered and the quantity.
- "In Preparation": When the canteen staff starts preparing an order, they can drag-and-drop the ticket to this column.
- "Ready for Pickup": Once the preparation is complete, the ticket moves here.

**Ticket Functionality:**
- Each new order ticket must automatically generate a unique token (e.g., #A123).
- Admins must have a button on each ticket to "Start Prep" and "Mark as Ready."
- When an order is marked as "Ready for Pickup," the system should automatically notify the user on their interface.

### 2. Inventory Management:
**Item List:** A table view of all available canteen items (Samosa, Vada, Chai, Cold Drink, etc.).

**Quantity Control:**
- Each item should have an editable "Current Quantity" field.
- The system must automatically decrement the quantity of an item whenever an order is placed.
- The canteen manager must be able to manually update the quantity at any time (e.g., when new stock arrives).
- Implement a "low stock" alert (e.g., highlight the item in red) when the quantity drops below a certain threshold (e.g., 10).

### 3. The AI-Powered Analytics Dashboard:
This dashboard will provide insights to the canteen manager.

**Sales Analytics:**
- Display day-wise sales figures in a clean line or bar chart.
- Show a "Best Selling Items" list for the day, week, and month.
- Show "Peak Hours" of operation based on order volume.

**Predictive Estimates:**
- Using historical data, the AI should provide an "Estimated Demand for Tomorrow" for key items. For example: "Based on last week's trend, you can expect to sell around 80-100 Samosas tomorrow."
- This will help the manager prepare ingredients and manage stock more effectively.

### 4. Menu & Item Management:
A simple interface for the admin to add new food items, update prices, change images, and modify estimated preparation times.
